**Abstract**

Cancer is still challenging to address nowadays. Early cancer detection through non-invasive liquid biopsy (NLB) can enable early patient-focused interventions. Considering its clinical significance, we were motivated to address the challenge of enhancing early cancer prevention. We propose an ensemble-optimized machine learning framework (EOLF) for clinical early cancer detection (CECD) using cell-free DNA fragmentation profiles and circulating biomarkers data from non-invasive liquid biopsy(NLB), termed $ClinicalEarlyCancerDF$. Different clinical case studies data are applied to evaluate the proposed $ClinicalEarlyCancerDF$ method and found better performances than other methods and existing studies. The first study of the DELFI cohort revealed the result for binary CECD with an accuracy of 89.89\% (Sensitivity=95.71\% and AUC=0.957) and localized CECD with a median accuracy of 86.84\% (AUC=0.983). For the second study of the same cohort using cfDNA mutation signature data, the proposed framework performed better than the recently published pointy method with an extended AUC value of 0.974 and an accuracy of 90.91\%.  The second CancerSEEK cohort case study also achieved better results for binary CECD with an accuracy of 98.18\% (AUC=0.999) and localized CECD with a median 94.85\% accuracy (AUC=0.996). Lastly, extensive analysis revealed the underlying mechanism behind this method. In addition, a platform-independent dynamic web application ($BiDiEarlyCancerDS$) was also implemented to render method performances and cancer detection for the first case study. The proposed optimized machine learning framework for CECD is well performed over existing methods in various aspect evaluations and cross-validation. This clinical cancer detection system with NLB can enhance the efficiency of early-stage cancer diagnosis and may enable cancer risk assessment for clinical oncologists and practitioners.
